- Objective : Build a model to detect fraudulent transactions using high class imbalanced transactions dataset
- Performed Random Undersampling, SMOTE to handle class imbalance and visualised data by using PCA algorithm
- Used InterQuartile Range method to remove outliers and applied Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines,
K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Trees to classify the data.
- Plotted ROC curve, Confusion Matrix of all models and concluded that k-NN performs best with F1 score of 0.83
